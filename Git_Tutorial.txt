Clone 					 -> create a copy on your machine (locally)
Repository (Git Version) -> Each user has their own version(branch). The main trunk
							must be updated via push and pull. Users commit to their
							local repository then request a push. 
							
Push					 -> Commit to remote repository. Usually needs to be approved

Pull					 -> Fetch commits from remote repo and stores in local branch
							Other users can do this at any time, stay up to date by
							pulling often (pull often for your health)
							
.gitignore(Git Ignore)   -> file type to be placed in root directory. specifies which
							local files to ignore during push/pull
							there are templates for this on github.
							https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore
